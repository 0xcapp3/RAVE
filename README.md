# RAVE: Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder

Official implementation of _RAVE: A variational autoencoder for fast and high-quality neural audio synthesis_ ([article link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05011)) by Antoine Caillon and Philippe Esling.

If you use RAVE as a part of a music performance or installation, be sure to cite either this repository or the article !

## Previous versions

The original implementation of the RAVE model can be restored using

```bash
git checkout v1
```

## Installation

Install RAVE using

```bash
pip install acids-rave
```

<!-- Detailed instructions to setup a training station for this project are available [here](docs/training_setup.md). -->


## Usage

Training a RAVE model usually involves 3 separate steps, namely _dataset preparation_, _training_ and _export_.

### Dataset preparation

### Training

### Export



## Discussion

If you have questions, want to share your experience with RAVE or share musical pieces done with the model, you can use the [Discussion tab](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE/discussions) !

## Demonstration

### RAVE x nn~

Demonstration of what you can do with RAVE and the nn~ external for maxmsp !

### embedded RAVE

Using nn~ for puredata, RAVE can be used in realtime on embedded platforms !
